DBMLFF: Linear scaling machine learning force fields via electron density decomposition for molecular electrolytes
=
We introduce a density-based machine learning force field (DBMLFF) that calculates intermolecular interactions based on fitted electron charge densities, while intramolecular energies are modeled using traditional atomic structure-based MLFF models. In addition, a local potential polarization model based on charge density calculations is introduced to describe polarization interactions between molecules. The main advantage of DBMLFF is that the form of its intermolecular interaction energies is physical based and only separate models and parameters need to be developed for each molecule, thus simplifying the potential field development process. For simulations of electrolyte systems, DBMLFF can accurately characterize the intermolecular interactions and is computationally three orders of magnitude faster than density functional theory in molecular dynamics.
